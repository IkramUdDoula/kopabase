# Features Directory

This directory contains modular feature areas of the application. Each major feature (e.g., metrics, storage) should have its own folder containing its components, hooks, and logic.

## Example Structure

- metrics/
- storage/

## Guidelines
- Place all feature-specific code here.
- Import shared utilities/components from src/components/ui or src/lib as needed.
- Keep feature modules self-contained for easy extension and maintenance.

# Kopabase

A bare minimum Supabase client for everyday admin work.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Supabase Database Table Management**
  - View all tables in your Supabase project
  - Sort, search, and select rows
  - Add, edit, and delete records
  - Multi-row selection and batch delete
  - Column sorting and search for all fields

- **Supabase Storage Management**
  - View all storage buckets in your project
  - Browse files in each bucket with a modern table UI
  - Sort, search, and select files
  - View file details: filename, size, uploaded date
  - Download/view files (with signed URLs for private buckets)
  - Delete one or multiple files with confirmation
  - Sort files by name, date, or size (client-side for size)
  - Search by filename, size, or uploaded date

- **Modern, Consistent UI/UX**
  - Responsive sidebar with collapsible Database and Storage sections
  - **Unified Pinned Section:** Pin your most-used tables and storage buckets for quick access. Pinned items appear together at the top of the sidebar, above all other sections.
  - Pin/unpin any table or bucket using the star icon next to each item. Pinned items are removed from their original section and shown only in the pinned section.
  - No table or bucket is selected by default. When you first connect or if nothing is selected, a friendly welcome message is shown in the main content area.
  - Sectioned layout: logo/header, pinned, database, storage, settings, disconnect
  - Table and storage file views use a unified card-based design
  - Inline search, sorting, and selection for all tables
  - Reload button for refreshing table or bucket data
  - Toast notifications for actions (save, delete, etc.)

- **Settings**
  - Configure max visibility duration for private file signed URLs
  - Settings are persisted locally and applied to all private file views

- **Extensible & Minimal**
  - Built with Next.js, React, and Supabase JS client
  - Modular, feature-based structure for easy extension
  - Centralized config and constants
  - Minimal dependencies and easy to maintain

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. Clone the repo and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```
2. Configure your Supabase project URL and keys in the app or via environment variables (see `src/config/settings.ts`).
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

## 📁 Project Structure

- `src/app/` — App entry and layout
- `src/components/ui/` — Generic, reusable UI components
- `src/features/` — Modular feature areas (e.g., metrics, storage)
- `src/hooks/` — Custom React hooks
- `src/lib/` — Supabase client and utilities
- `src/config/` — Centralized constants and settings
- `public/` — Static assets and icons

## 🧩 Adding New Features

- Create a new folder in `src/features/` for your feature (e.g., `src/features/your-feature/`).
- Place all feature-specific components, hooks, and logic in that folder.
- Import shared UI components from `src/components/ui/` and utilities from `src/lib/` as needed.
- Add any new constants or settings to `src/config/constants.ts` or `src/config/settings.ts`.

## 🏗️ Contribution Guidelines

- Keep code modular and reusable.
- Centralize all constants and settings in `src/config/`.
- Add JSDoc/comments to complex utilities and components.
- Follow the existing file/folder naming conventions.
- See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for more details (coming soon).
